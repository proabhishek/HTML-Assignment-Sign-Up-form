# HTML-Assignment-Sign-Up-form


Implement a sign-up form in HTML with the following six input fields, each with an appropriate label:
	
Username, a required text input field
	
Password, a required password input field
	
Email, a required email input field
	
Phone Number, an optional telephone input field
	
Date of Birth, an optional date-picker input field
	
I agree to the TOS, a required checkbox input field


There should also be a Sign Up button at the bottom of the form. When clicked on (and if all required fields have been filled), the button should submit the form using default browser behavior.
